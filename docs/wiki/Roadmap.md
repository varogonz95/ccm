# Roadmap and limits

The full plan is in [`docs/PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md).

## Milestones

- **M0, PTY layer:** done. Unix verified by tests; Windows compiles and needs a manual run.
- **M1, agent API:** done. Create, list, kill, attach, scrollback replay, token auth.
- **M2, hub:** mostly done. `hosts`, `ls`, `new`, `attach`, `kill` work. Still to come: an interactive TUI with a session list you can attach to and return from.
- **Web UI:** done. `clawsh web` serves a browser dashboard with a full-page terminal (loopback only). Next: LAN access (#6), editing hosts from the page (#8).
- **Auto-agent plugin:** proof of concept. The Claude Code [plugin](Plugin.md) starts an agent if none runs and lists sessions started outside clawsh as `external`. Linux verified; Windows and macOS need a manual check.
- **M3, status and alerts:** next. Claude Code hooks will report `working`, `idle` and `needs_input`; the hub will show badges and ring the bell when a session needs you.
- **M4, hardening:** agent as a system service, hub auto-reconnect, Windows Job Objects, a resize policy for multiple viewers.

Later: split-pane views, mDNS discovery, TLS or Tailscale, sessions that survive agent restarts.

## Known limits

- Only sessions started through clawsh are managed. A `claude` launched in a plain terminal shows up in `ls` as `external` when the [plugin](Plugin.md) is installed, but can't be attached to or killed.
- Sessions stop when the agent stops. `claude --resume` recovers the conversation.
- Status is `running` or `exited` only, until M3.
- On Windows, killing a session doesn't yet kill claude's child processes.
- With several viewers, the last resize wins.
- On Windows, typing into a session right after it exits can misbehave in the agent. Tracked in issue #12.
